# Mergington High School Activities

A super simple website application that allows teachers to manage student registrations for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Teacher authentication for activity management
- **Simplified student registration** - Teachers can quickly register students using just usernames
- Auto-complete suggestions for existing students
- Quick unregistration with confirmation dialogs

## Simplified Teacher Workflow

Teachers can now register students more efficiently:

1. **Login** with teacher credentials
2. **Click "Register Student"** on any activity
3. **Type just the username** (e.g., "michael") - no need for full email addresses
4. **Select from suggestions** or type new usernames
5. **Submit** - the system automatically creates the full email (michael@mergington.edu)

The interface shows the @mergington.edu domain visually, provides autocomplete suggestions, and includes helpful hints for a streamlined experience.
